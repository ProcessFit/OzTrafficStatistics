# Australian Road Traffic Data Visualisation

This application presents the Traffic fatalities by State, Gender, Road Type User, Age group as annual data from 1993 to 2017.  The original data can be found at the Australian Government data portal, `data.gov.au`, at the following url: 
      
 -  https://data.gov.au/dataset/australian-road-deaths-database/resource/fd646fdc-7788-4bea-a736-e4aeb0dd09a8.
 
The application allows users to plot traffic accidents by frequency based on the time of day, or as a time-series. The charts can be configured to allow the users to plot by State, Gender, Age Group or Road User Type.

The data indicates significant improvements overall in road fatalities over the time period. An exception is for male motor cycle riders in the 40-65 years age group, which show an increasing trend in fatalities.  For older, and presumably more experienced drivers, most accidents occur in the middle of the afternoon, while for younger drivers, the evening and early hours of the morning produce more fatalities.



This application was created in December 2017 as part of completion of the Coursera course by John Hopkins University: **Developing Data Products**.
